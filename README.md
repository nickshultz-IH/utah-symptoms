# Find the Right Care Tool

This project is a simple, client-side wayfinding tool that helps patients decide whether to use **Telehealth, Urgent Care, or the Emergency Department** based on entered symptoms.

## Features
- Symptom input with triage routing
- Clear escalation for emergencies (911)
- Action cards for Telehealth, Urgent Care, and ER
- No PHI stored (runs entirely in the browser)

## Files
- `index.html`: Main page with structure and styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic placeholder (replace with full logic from ChatGPT).
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview the tool.
2. Edit `script.js` to include the triage logic, red flag keywords, and location lists.
3. Replace placeholders with your organizationâ€™s Telehealth contact info and locations.
4. Deploy the files on your web server.

## Disclaimer
This tool is for **informational wayfinding only**. It does not provide medical advice. Always direct emergencies to **911**.
